1. I think that the code should require exactly 5 unique, non-empty items. Currently, it only checks that all inputs are filled, not checking any duplicates.

2. As of right now, the UI lacks a lot of color. The page is entirely either white, black, or grey. It could use some color to make the application stand out a little bit more. This app is supposed to be a social media platform, so it should have more color.

3. The developer could also add some error handling to help show the user where they went wrong (i.e. not having unique items or their list filled out completely).
